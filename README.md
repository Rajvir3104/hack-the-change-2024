## Inspiration
Pathways was inspired by the desire to promote peace and inclusion for refugees, and immigrants. Recognizing the challenges newcomers face—such as language barriers, navigation difficulties, job scarcity, and mental health support disparities—Pathways aims to create a supportive digital space that facilitates a smoother transition and fosters community connections.

## What it does
Pathways is a compassionate platform designed to empower refugees and immigrants in their journey toward a fulfilling life in a new society. It addresses critical needs by offering:
- A **Resource Navigator** integrated with a Maps API to help locate cultural cuisines promoting cultural connection.
- **Language Translation Support** for real-time translation of content, enabling users to understand resources in their preferred language.
- An **Employment Aggregator** that provides tailored job postings and application guidance.
- **Cultural and Mental Health Support** through testimonials, mental health resources, and an event calendar to foster belonging and social connections.

## How we built it
We built Pathways using React as the primary front-end framework, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud handling backend infrastructure and services. This was our first time using both AWS and Google Cloud, which provided robust solutions for storage, computing, and data management, supporting the platform's scalability and reliability.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we encountered included integrating a seamless multi-language translation tool and curating relevant resources for diverse user needs. Additionally, ensuring the platform remained intuitive and accessible while supporting complex functionalities, like job matching and mental health resources, required careful design and iterative testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a platform that not only addresses practical challenges like employment and navigation but also prioritizes mental well-being and cultural connection. Our success in combining these elements into a cohesive, user-friendly platform reflects our commitment to creating meaningful support for newcomers.

## What we learned
Using AWS and Google Cloud for the first time provided valuable insights into cloud computing and data management. Building Pathways taught us the importance of empathy-driven design in technology. We deepened our understanding of the specific challenges faced by refugees and immigrants and the ways digital solutions can foster inclusivity, peace, and community.

## What's next for Pathways
Moving forward, we aim to enhance Pathways by adding more localized resources, improving the employment aggregator, and potentially introducing virtual support groups. We hope to continue refining Pathways to better support newcomers on their journey to belonging.
