# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Inspiration
Pathways was inspired by the desire to promote peace and inclusion for refugees, and immigrants. Recognizing the challenges newcomers face—such as language barriers, navigation difficulties, job scarcity, and mental health support disparities—Pathways aims to create a supportive digital space that facilitates a smoother transition and fosters community connections.

## What it does
Pathways is a compassionate platform designed to empower refugees and immigrants in their journey toward a fulfilling life in a new society. It addresses critical needs by offering:
- A **Resource Navigator** integrated with a Maps API to help locate cultural cuisines promoting cultural connection.
- **Language Translation Support** for real-time translation of content, enabling users to understand resources in their preferred language.
- An **Employment Aggregator** that provides tailored job postings and application guidance.
- **Cultural and Mental Health Support** through testimonials, mental health resources, and an event calendar to foster belonging and social connections.

## How we built it
We built Pathways using React as the primary front-end framework, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud handling backend infrastructure and services. This was our first time using both AWS and Google Cloud, which provided robust solutions for storage, computing, and data management, supporting the platform's scalability and reliability.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we encountered included integrating a seamless multi-language translation tool and curating relevant resources for diverse user needs. Additionally, ensuring the platform remained intuitive and accessible while supporting complex functionalities, like job matching and mental health resources, required careful design and iterative testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a platform that not only addresses practical challenges like employment and navigation but also prioritizes mental well-being and cultural connection. Our success in combining these elements into a cohesive, user-friendly platform reflects our commitment to creating meaningful support for newcomers.

## What we learned
Using AWS and Google Cloud for the first time provided valuable insights into cloud computing and data management. Building Pathways taught us the importance of empathy-driven design in technology. We deepened our understanding of the specific challenges faced by refugees and immigrants and the ways digital solutions can foster inclusivity, peace, and community.

## What's next for Pathways
Moving forward, we aim to enhance Pathways by adding more localized resources, improving the employment aggregator, and potentially introducing virtual support groups. We hope to continue refining Pathways to better support newcomers on their journey to belonging.
